 * @class GalbotNavigation
 * @brief Navigation interface for mobile robot chassis motion planning and localization.
 *
 * This class provides a thread-safe singleton interface for controlling the mobile base
 * navigation system. It supports 2D pose estimation, relocalization, goal-directed navigation
 * with dynamic obstacle avoidance, and path planning capabilities.
 *
 * The navigation system operates in a global map frame and provides both blocking and
 * non-blocking navigation modes. It supports both differential drive and omnidirectional
 * motion planning strategies.
 *
 * @note This class uses the singleton pattern with thread-safe initialization.
 * @note All pose coordinates are specified in the map frame unless explicitly stated otherwise.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * @code
 *   auto& nav = GalbotNavigation::get_instance(MachineType::G1);
 *   if (nav.init()) {
 *     Pose goal;
 *     goal.x = 1.0;  // meters
 *     goal.y = 2.0;  // meters
 *     goal.orientation.w = 1.0;  // identity quaternion (x,y,z default 0)
 *     nav.navigate_to_goal(goal, true, false, 30.0, true);
 *   }
 * @endcode
